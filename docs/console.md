# Running the console

The console is the glossary's editing tool. The facilitator works entirely inside it —
open a page, make changes, publish. There is no need to visit GitHub, run any commands,
or understand version control. The repository underneath is plumbing.

## What the repository does

| File | Written when | Contains |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `data/glossary.json` | you press **Publish** | the published glossary the public site reads |
| `.console/draft.json` | every hour, automatically | the work in progress |

Committing `data/glossary.json` *is* publishing: the site rebuilds itself from that
file within a minute or two.

The draft file holds only the **difference** from the published version, not a full
copy. A full copy is about 2.9MB; the difference is usually a couple of kilobytes. That
keeps a daily commit from bloating the repository over a months-long editing cycle.

## Why the draft is saved at all

Between publishes the working draft lives in this browser's IndexedDB, on one machine.
Clearing site data, a browser reset or a dead laptop would take four months of work with
it. The daily save means the repository always holds something recent, and the history
means any earlier day can be recovered.

It happens quietly — on load if an hour has passed, and again during a long session.
**Save draft now** forces it. If more than a day goes by without a save reaching the
repository, the panel says so rather than failing silently.

## One-time setup

Do this once, on the facilitator's machine, on their behalf. They never need to see the
token or know it exists.

1. Create a fine-grained access token:
   - GitHub → Settings → Developer settings → Personal access tokens → Fine-grained
   - **Resource owner**: the account that owns the repository, not your personal account
   - **Repository access**: only `glossary`
   - **Repository permissions**: **Contents: read and write** — nothing else
   - **Expiration**: up to a year. Diarise the renewal; it is your job, not theirs.
2. Open the console and press **Sign in…** in the panel on the left
3. Enter the facilitator's name, the repository (`owner/repository`), the branch
   (`main`), and the token. The name is recorded on every change — the token belongs
   to the account rather than the person, so without it the history cannot tell one
   facilitator from another.
4. Press **Check and save**, then accept the offer to load from the repository.

The token is stored in this browser only and is sent nowhere except GitHub. Anyone who
can use this browser profile can publish, so treat the machine as you would one holding
any other publishing credential.

When the token expires the console says so plainly, keeps the draft safe locally, and
carries on letting them edit. Nothing is lost; it just stops saving until reconnected.

## The members' spreadsheet

The public glossary points members at the MISMO Resource Library for a spreadsheet copy:

  https://collaborate.mismo.org/viewdocument/business-glossary

That file has to be produced, and **Download Excel (.xlsx)** under *Backups & earlier
versions* is what produces it — every term with its classifications and links, as a real
spreadsheet with a frozen header and filters. Produce it after publishing a version and
upload it to the Resource Library, so the two do not drift apart.

## Classification descriptions

Each term type, focus area and source carries a description, and that is what appears
under it on the public glossary. They are edited under **Manage classifications** — every
value shows its description, and **Description** opens an editor beneath it.

Values with none are marked in amber and counted at the foot of the panel, because a
value without one shows on the public site as having no published description.

**Suggest wording** offers a first draft in the phrasing MISMO already uses — focus areas
read *"A set of terms typically used in…"*, sources *"A set of terms sourced from…"* — with
the value's name spelled out from its camel case. It is a starting point to rewrite, not
an answer: it exists because an empty box is the reason descriptions go unwritten. Adding
a new value opens its editor straight away, since the moment a classification is created
is the moment its meaning is known.

Descriptions travel with the draft and are written to `data/reference.json` when a version
is published. Editing one changes no terms, so it produces no draft changes — but it is
still saved and published like any other edit.

## Guided tour

The console opens a short guided tour the first time it is used, and it can be reopened at
any time from **Getting started** in the top right. It spotlights each part of the screen in
turn, opens the edit form and stages an example so the pending area has something in it,
and cleans up after itself. With sound on it reads each step aloud and moves on when it
finishes; the speaker button beside **Close tour** silences it.

The voice comes from the browser. The natural-sounding ones — the console prefers
**Sonia** — are only available in **Microsoft Edge** and need a network connection.
Other browsers fall back to whatever built-in voice the computer has.

## The panel on the left

Two headline numbers: how many terms there are, and how many need a human decision.
Beneath them the sections carry a coloured edge in their own state — green when settled,
amber when something wants attention. Anything that *replaces* what is in the browser
(loading the online copy, importing a change-set, restoring a backup) sits behind a drawer
that says so, since each discards unsaved work.

## Publishing is protected

The console refuses to publish, and will not save automatically, while the repository holds
a newer draft than this browser has loaded. Without that, a fresh browser — which starts
from the copy of the glossary shipped inside the console — could publish that older copy
over every version since. The panel says when this is the case and offers to load.

## Day-to-day

1. Open the console. It loads the draft from this browser and checks the repository in
   the background.
2. Edit. Search, bulk-tag, fix flagged issues, add or remove terms. Everything stages
   for review; nothing changes the draft until applied.
3. The draft saves itself to the repository every hour.
4. When the working group has agreed a version, press **Publish**. That commits the new
   glossary, updates the site, and downloads a change-set CSV as a record of what
   changed for the group.

## Handing over to a new facilitator

The facilitator will change over time. Nothing about the glossary is tied to an
individual, so a handover is short:

1. **Revoke the outgoing token.** GitHub → Settings → Developer settings → Fine-grained
   tokens → delete it. This takes effect immediately and everywhere, including any copy
   still sitting in the old browser. Revocation, not a password, is the real control
   here.
2. **Ask them to press Save draft now before they finish**, so nothing is stranded. The
   hourly save means at most an hour is ever at risk, but a clean final save costs
   nothing.
3. **Issue a new token** for the incoming facilitator, on the same terms: this
   repository only, Contents read and write.
4. On their machine, press **Sign in…**, enter their name and the new token, then accept
   the offer to load the online copy.

They receive the published glossary and the most recent saved draft. Nothing needs to
be copied off the old laptop, and the old laptop keeps nothing usable.

Because each person enters their own name, the history shows who made which change
across the whole succession, even though every commit is authored by the same account.

## If two people ever edit

The design assumes one editor. If a second person edits in another browser, the second
publish fails rather than overwriting the first — the commit is not forced. Recovery is
to load from the repository and redo the lost edits, so avoid the situation rather than
relying on the safeguard.

## If something goes wrong

**"The access token was rejected."** It expired or was revoked. Issue a new one and
press Connect. The draft is untouched.

**A publish failed.** Nothing was written; the repository and the draft are both as
they were. Retry. If it keeps failing, the change-set CSV still downloads, so a version
can be produced by hand.

**The draft looks wrong or has been lost.** Every daily save is in the repository's
history. `.console/draft.json` at any past commit can be restored — ask whoever
administers the repository.

**Starting fresh on a new machine.** Sign in, then accept the offer to load — or later, open
**Replace what is in this browser** and choose **Load the online copy**. That pulls the
published glossary plus the most recent saved draft.
